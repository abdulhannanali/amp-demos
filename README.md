## AMP-Demos

This repo is a `next.js` project. Itâ€™s responsible for generating [amp-demos.herokuapp.com](https://amp-demos.herokuapp.com/) - _a collection of AMP for Email examples written for and tested in Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC)_.

You can read more about this on the [Salesforce Developer Blog](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2021/03/create-interactive-emails-with-amp-and-marketing-cloud.html).

Here is a detailed list of the amp4email sample files which may be found in the `amp-demos` directory.

- `demo.html` - amp4email markup that has been tested and validated. Most likely, it is connected to an external `.json` data source. It may require customization in order to accommodate custom environments.
- `demo.json` - static example of the `.json` used in the related amp4email example. Some examples utilize data sources that are hard coded, while some utilize [Server-Side JavaScript](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.noversion.mc-programmatic-content.meta/mc-programmatic-content/ssjs_serverSideJavaScript.htm) to dynamically generate `.json`.
- `meta.json` - content for each example, and used purely for populating the layout and presentation with content.
- `demo.js` - examples of [Server-Side JavaScript](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.noversion.mc-programmatic-content.meta/mc-programmatic-content/ssjs_serverSideJavaScript.htm) responsible for generating the `.json`. Please let this serve as an example, as these represent minimal technique to ensure simplicity in the example.
